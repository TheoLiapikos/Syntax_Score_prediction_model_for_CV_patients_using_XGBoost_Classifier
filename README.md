# Machine Learning Algorithm to Predict Obstructive Coronary Artery Disease: Insights from the CorLipid Trial

This project contains the Python code used for the implementation of the paper '*Panteris, E.; Deda, O.; Papazoglou, A.S.; Karagiannidis, E.; Liapikos, T.; Begou, O.; Meikopoulos, T.; Mouskeftara, T.; Sofidis, G.; Sianos, G.; et al. Machine Learning Algorithm to Predict Obstructive Coronary Artery Disease: Insights from the CorLipid Trial. Metabolites 2022, 12, 816. https://doi.org/10.3390/metabo12090816*'.

The code is provided in 2 functionally equivalent formats, either as a Python Script file, or as a Jupyter Notebook file.

The '*Study's Results*' folder contains the results and statistical treatment of 10 representative analyses of the study dataset with the algorithm, similar to those on which the final results of the CorLipid Trial were based.

***ATTENTION***: The original CorLipid Trial dataset is not provided. The '*Dataset*' folder contains a synthetic, random dataset, which can only be used to demonstrate the functionality of the code and not to reproduce the results of the CorLipid Trial.
